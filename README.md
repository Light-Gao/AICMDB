# Description
I tried to find some popular open source CMDB system, I succeed. <br/>
And then I tired to pick up one whick should be easy to handle, I failed.</br>
I am not sure why, and I do not want to figure it out. Since I decide to make one all by myself.

## How to start
1. Clone this project;
2. Install python3(at least python3.5.2) on your host;
3. Change directory into AICMDB, then execute `python manager.py`;
4. You may browser it through http://ip:6688(which configured in enums/globalenums.py);

## License
GPL license, which means you must keep it as open source project no matter what and keep the same license in your project.
